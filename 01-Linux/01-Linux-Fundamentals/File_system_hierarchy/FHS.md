# Linux File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

The **File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)** defines how Linux organizes files and directories.  
It ensures that every Linux distribution follows the same logical structure, so system components, programs, and users know exactly where to find configuration files, logs, executables, and devices.

---

# 1. Core Principles

## **1.1 Root Directory `/`**
The root directory (`/`) is the top-level directory in Linux.  
Every file and directory in the system originates from `/`.

All filesystem components must be mounted somewhere under `/`.

---

## **1.2 Logical Structure vs. Physical Storage**
Linux separates the **directory tree** from the **underlying disks/partitions**.

Example:
- `/home` may be located on a completely separate disk or partition.
- `/var` may be mounted on another drive for better performance.

Even though the physical locations differ, the path structure remains consistent.

---

## **1.3 Predictable Directory Layout**
The FHS ensures consistent locations for:
- configuration files  
- system binaries  
- user data  
- log files  
- device interfaces  
- temporary storage  

This consistency makes Linux reliable and organized.

# 2. Important Directories in the FHS

Below is an expanded explanation of the most important directories and what they contain.

---

## **2.1 `/etc` — System Configuration**
Contains system-wide configuration files.

Examples:
- `/etc/hostname` — system hostname
- `/etc/hosts` — static host resolution
- `/etc/fstab` — mount points
- `/etc/ssh/` — SSH server configuration
- `/etc/passwd` — user account list

Files here are usually plain text and editable by administrators.

---

## **2.2 `/bin` — Essential User Binaries**
Contains essential commands required for basic system operation.

Examples:
- `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`
- `cat`, `chmod`, `touch`

These commands must be available even if other filesystems fail to mount.

---

## **2.3 `/sbin` — System Administration Binaries**
Contains system administration tools used mainly by root.

Examples:
- `fsck` — filesystem check  
- `mount` / `umount` — mount control  
- `reboot` / `shutdown`  
- `ip` — network configuration  

These commands are essential for managing and repairing the system.

---

## **2.4 `/usr` — User Programs and Applications**
One of the largest directories.  
Contains most user command binaries, libraries, and installed applications.

Structure inside `/usr`:
- `/usr/bin` → main user commands  
- `/usr/sbin` → admin commands  
- `/usr/lib` → libraries  
- `/usr/share` → static shared data  
- `/usr/local` → manually installed software  

Many third-party applications install here.

---

## **2.5 `/home` — User Home Directories**
Contains personal directories for normal users.

Example:
- `/home/jafar`
- `/home/ahmad`

Each home directory stores:
- documents  
- downloads  
- user-specific configuration files  
- SSH keys (`.ssh/`)  

---

## **2.6 `/root` — Root User’s Home**
The home directory for the root user.

Not the same as `/` (the root of the filesystem).  
Used for storing:
- administrative scripts  
- sensitive files  
- private keys  

---

## **2.7 `/var` — Variable Data**
Contains data that changes frequently.

Subdirectories:
- `/var/log` → system logs  
- `/var/lib` → databases (e.g., MySQL data)  
- `/var/cache` → cache files  
- `/var/spool` → queued jobs (print, mail)  

This directory often grows over time, especially logs.

---

## **2.8 `/tmp` — Temporary Files**
Used for temporary, short-lived files.

Notes:
- Accessible by all users  
- Often cleared automatically on reboot  
- Programs use `/tmp` for temporary storage  

---

## **2.9 `/dev` — Device Files**
Linux represents devices as files under `/dev`.

Examples:
- `/dev/sda` — first disk  
- `/dev/null` — discard output  
- `/dev/tty` — terminal interface  
- `/dev/random` — random number generator  

These files act as interfaces to physical or virtual devices.

---

## **2.10 `/proc` — Kernel and Process Information**
A virtual filesystem that provides runtime system information.

Examples:
- `/proc/cpuinfo` → CPU details  
- `/proc/meminfo` → memory status  
- `/proc/uptime` → system uptime  
- `/proc/<PID>/` → information about active processes  

These files are dynamically generated by the kernel.

---

# 3. Additional Directories

## **3.1 `/opt`**
Used for optional or third-party software packages.
Example:  
`/opt/google/chrome/`

---

## **3.2 `/media`**
Temporary mount point for external devices such as:
- USB drives  
- DVDs  
- external hard disks  

---

## **3.3 `/mnt`**
Generic mount point used manually by administrators for temporary mounts.

Example:
```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
````

---

## **3.4 `/run`**

Contains runtime data for processes and services after boot.

Example:

* PID files
* active socket files
* temporary runtime data
